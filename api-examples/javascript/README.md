#Volunteer Match API v2
##Javascript Examples
###Simple AJAX Example
[SimpleAjaxExample.html](SimpleAjaxExample.html) is a very basic example that generates a password digest using Moment.js and CryptoJS and then calls the searchOpportunities action of the API using a jQuery AJAX call. The response is simply printed to the client console.

*NOTE: You must enter your private API Key and Username for this example to work*

###Opportunity Search Example
[OpportunitySearchExample.html](OpportunitySearchExample.html) is a more advanced and polished web page that displays opportunities based on user input. Fill out the form and hit *Find Opportunities* for the results to be displayed in the feed along with all pertinent info.

*NOTE: You must enter your private API Key and Username for this example to work*

###API Console
[ApiConsole.html](ApiConsole.html) is a fun little proof of concept. You should be able to enter your API Key and Username along with which action you want to hit and the corresponding query to test any functionality of the API.
