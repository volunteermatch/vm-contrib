## Federating with the VolunteerMatch Open Network

The VolunteerMatch Open Network API allows access to the [VolunteerMatch Network](https://www.volunteermatch.org). The API allows VolunteerMatch Partner systems to publish and update volunteer opportunities to the VolunteerMatch Open Network where they are available to the full range of volunteers visiting both the VolunteerMatch website, as well as all partner systems that display and recruit for volunteers.   

### Becoming a Partner

### Federation Documentation
Federation is powered by VolunteerMatch non-profit administrators granting federated systems permissions to administer their accounts on their behalf. For details on how to implement the OAuth2 authorization code grant with VolunteerMatch, please see [Authorizing OAuth Apps](https://github.com/volunteermatch/vm-contrib/blob/master/federation/AUTHORIZE.md)

### Federation Example Code
See the following simple node-express example website to demonstrate possible federation implementation. [Federated Partner Sample](https://github.com/volunteermatch/vm-contrib/tree/master/federation/samplePartner)
